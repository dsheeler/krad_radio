### Overview

Krad Radio is a daemon that is controlled locally or remotely by Krad Radio clients.
Clients are written using the Krad Radio clientlib, writing clients that directly speak
the Krad Radio IPC protocol is not advisable or supported. Clients can be command line, 
ncurses, GUI or web based, and any number of clients can be connected to the daemon at 
any time. This design is directly inspired from the design of XMMS2.

The Krad Radio daemon can be thought of in three parts, the mixer, the compositor and 
the transponder.

                   [Compositor]
[Incoming A/V] >>               >> [Outgoing A/V]
                     [Mixer]


A/V can come and go from a variety of things, files, network streams, or local A/V hardware.
