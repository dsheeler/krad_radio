Krad Radio - http://kradradio.com

Krad Radio is a daemon that is controlled locally or remotely by clients. Each
running daemon is a station. Clients are written using the client API library.

A station has three main components. The mixer, compositor and transponder.
The transponder connects audio to the mixer and video to the compositor.

Mixed/Composited Paths:

                     raw-input -> comp/mixer -> raw-output
                     raw-input -> comp/mixer -> encoder -> muxer -> fd-output
fd-input -> demuxer -> decoder -> comp/mixer -> raw-output
fd-input -> demuxer -> decoder -> comp/mixer -> encoder -> muxer -> fd-output

Non Mixed/Composited Paths:

                               hw-encoder -> muxer -> fd-output
                      fd-input -> demuxer -> muxer -> fd-output
fd-input -> demuxer -> decoder -> encoder -> muxer -> fd-output
