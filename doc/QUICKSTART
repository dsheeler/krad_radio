Foo Station QUICKSTART
----------------------

Replace "foosta" with the sysname* of your station.

*What is a sysname? It's just a simple name or 'callsign' for your station
 for use in the command line. Rules: 4-40 characters, lowercase alphanumeric,
 starts with a letter. Don't worry you can use fancy UTF8 strings for pretty
 much everything else.
